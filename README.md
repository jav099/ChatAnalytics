**** Chat Analytics ****

by Javier Contreras

**** Instructions for use: ****

1. Export your desired Whatsapp chat through the Whatsapp mobile app, and save as .txt it in the directory where the program is located
2. Using terminal type "make main.exe" (while in directory)
3. type: ./main.exe yourChatTxtFilename YourName NameOfTheOtherPersonInTheChat
NOTE: You MUST use the names as they appear on Whatsapp (both yours and the other person's) otherwise, program won't work.
TROUBLESHOOTING: If problems arise, change the Whatsapp contact name to just a first name, no last name, then go to step 1 again.
4. A file called csvData.txt is included in the repo, this is an example of how and in what order the program outputs the data
5. run the python file plots.py, this will otput as images all the graphs to the same directory the rest of the program is on.
NOTE: this will overwrite csvData.txt
6. There should be 7 images with graphs in the folder now.
